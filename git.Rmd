## R Markdown

This is the first ocument. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
cars %>% 
  ggplot(aes(speed, dist)) + geom_point()
```

## Including Plots and graphs in R is cool

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
